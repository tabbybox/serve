# serve -l 3000

the ["serve" from vercel](https://github.com/vercel/serve) is way too slow to start and stop, and clearly i'm too impatient to wait for it

Like literally what is going on with these **3 whole seconds**?

*Now this cured my ADHD for a bit* (it started too fast i don't even bother timing it)

## Installation
btw I use arch:
`serve` is available on AUR
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/serve-bin

You don't?
1. Install go
2. Clone the whole thing
3. `go build .`
4. Copy the executable to wherever you want
